			<h2 class="auto-style2">Welcome to...</h2>
			<h1 class="auto-style2">Dr. Khalil Awad’s website</h1>
			<p><strong>Have you</strong> ever felt like you are missing a healthier 
			life? We have all had this feeling at one time or another, but the truth 
			is; it’s never too early or too late to step up your journey to wellness.</p>
			<p><strong>Wellness is</strong> a journey of vitality, health, performance, 
			potential, energy, attitude, and so much more!</p>
			<p><strong>Wellness starts</strong> with a lifestyle that includes Chiropractic 
			Care. </p>
			<p>Our main objective is to accurately detect, diagnose, and treat the 
			regions of your body that are causing dysfunction. It is critical that 
			an accurate diagnosis be obtained for proper patient treatment and recovery.</p>
			<p>As a gentle, caring Doctor of Chiropractic, Dr. Awad has been trained, 
			licensed, and have years of experience in successfully evaluating patients. 
			He doesn’t just treat your symptoms. He treats the real cause of your 
			health issues. He is dedicated to helping you have a better outlook 
			on life.</p>
			<p><strong>Dr. Awad</strong> takes the proper time to understand your 
			needs and then gets to the root of concerns. He believes the key to 
			good health is proper function. With the focused care of Parkway East 
			Chiropractic, you’ll start feeling and living better in no time!</p>
			<p>When you arrive at Parkway East Chiropractic, we take the time to 
			explain what we find and customize a program that will help you get 
			back to life as quickly as possible. Our friendly staff will help you 
			every step of the way. We also have access to the most modern and up-to-date 
			technologies, should that become necessary.<img alt="back pain" height="298" src="images/chiropractic.jpg" style="float: right" width="172" /></p>
			<p>If you have visited another Chiropractic clinic and found yourself 
			receiving the same treatments over and over and feel like a number and 
			not a patient...then visit us. No routine, run of the mill, nor generic 
			programs here at Parkway East Chiropractic. You will have a personal 
			treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.</p>
			<p><strong>Now, Alleviate Pain - YES!</strong> But, it’s not about eliminating 
			pain today; it’s about living healthy and pain-free for all of your 
			tomorrows. That's why, once you're out of pain-whether it's back pain, 
			neck pain, headaches, extremity pain, or other problems- we'll teach 
			you how stay that way.</p>
			<p>Parkway East Chiropractic also provides care for auto accidents and 
			work injury cases. Our goal is to provide our patients with the best 
			possible care and to get you back to a full and healthy life as quickly 
			as possible!</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>To Your Health</p>
			<p>Dr. Khalil Awad</p>
